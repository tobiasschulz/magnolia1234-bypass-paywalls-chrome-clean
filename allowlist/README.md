# Add extension (crx) to allowlist

* [Windows](#windows)
* [macOS](#macOS)
* [Linux](#linux)

### Windows

Run as administrator one of the reg-files in [allowlist-downloads](https://gitlab.com/magnolia1234/bypass-paywalls-chrome-clean/-/tree/master/allowlist)  
If you already added extensions to the allowlist than you should change "1" to a new key (also change name of HLM-key for beta/developer versions of browsers).  
Example Chrome-regfile:  
```
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00  
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Google\Chrome\ExtensionInstallAllowlist]  
"1"="lkbebcjgcmobigpeffafkodonchffocl"
```

### macOS

Run one of the .mobileconfig files in [allowlist-downloads](https://gitlab.com/magnolia1234/bypass-paywalls-chrome-clean/-/tree/master/whitelist) (requires admin rights)  
Finally restart the browser's process (in the Dock: right click on Chrome, 'Quit', reopen).   
This assumes your device is not being managed by MDM software and you don't have any profile related to the 'ExtensionInstallAllowlist' policy already active.

### Linux

[Chromium-based browsers allow local installations of extensions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/hosting/#hosting), so not necessary :)
